FAQ

What are the advantages of running a model with TensorRT Inference Server compared to running directly using the model's framework API?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When using TensorRT Inference Server the inference result will be the
same as when using the model's framework directly. However, with the
inference server we get benefits like :ref:`concurrent model execution
<section-concurrent-model-execution>` (the ability to run multiple
models at the same time on the same GPU) and :ref:`dynamic batching
<section-dynamic-batcher>` to get better throughput. We can also
:ref:`replace or upgrade models while the inference server and client
application are running <section-model-management>`. Another benefit
is that the inference server can be deployed as a Docker container,
anywhere â€“ on premises and on public clouds. TensorRT Inference Server
also :ref:`supports several frameworks <section-model-repository>`
such as TensorRT, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX on both GPUs and CPUs
leading to a streamlined deployment.

Can TensorRT Inference Server run on systems that don't have GPUs?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, see :ref:`section-running-the-inference-server-without-gpu`.

Can TensorRT Inference Server be used in non-Docker environments?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Yes. TensorRT Inference Server has a CMake build that allows the
inference server to be built from source making it more portable to
non-Docker environments. For more details, see
:ref:`section-building-the-server-with-cmake`. After building you can
then run the inference server outside of Docker as described in
:ref:`section-running-the-inference-server-without-docker`.

How would you use TensorRT Inference Server within the AWS environment?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In an AWS environment, the TensorRT Inference Server docker container
can run on :ref:`CPU-only instances
<section-running-the-inference-server-without-gpu>` or GPU compute
instances. The inference server can run directly on the compute
instance or inside Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). In addition,
other AWS services such as Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) can be used for
load balancing traffic among multiple inference server
instances. Elastic Block Store (EBS) or S3 can be used for storing
deep-learning models loaded by the inference server.

How do I measure the performance of my model running in the TensorRT Inference Server?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The TensorRT Inference Server exposes performance information in two
ways: by :ref:`Prometheus metrics <section-metrics>` and by the
:ref:`Status API <section-api-status>`.

A client application, :ref:`perf_client
<section-performance-example>`, allows you to measure the performance
of an individual model using a synthetic load. The perf\_client
application is designed to show you the tradeoff of latency
vs. throughput.

How can I fully utilize the GPU with TensorRT Inference Server?
---------------------------------------------------------------

TensorRT Inference Server has several features designed to increase
GPU utilization:

* The inference server can :ref:`simultaneous perform inference for
  multiple models <section-concurrent-model-execution>` (using either
  the same or different frameworks) using the same GPU.

* The inference server can increase inference throughput by using
  :ref:`multiple instances of the same model
  <section-concurrent-model-execution>` to handle multiple simultaneous
  inferences requests to that model. The inference server chooses
  reasonable defaults but :ref:`you can also control the exact level of
  concurrency <section-instance-groups>` on a model-by-model basis.

* The inference server can :ref:`batch together multiple inference
  requests into a single inference execution
  <section-dynamic-batcher>`. Typically, batching inference requests
  leads to much higher thoughput with only a relatively small increase
  in latency.

As a general rule, batching is the most beneficial way to increase GPU
utilization. So you should alway try enabling the :ref:`dynamic
batcher <section-dynamic-batcher>` with your models. Using multiple
instances of a model can also provide some benefit but is typically
most useful for models that have small compute requirements. Most
models will benefit from using two instances but more than that is
often not useful.

If I have a server with multiple GPUs should I use one TensorRT Inference Server to manage all GPUs or should I use multiple inference servers, one for each GPU?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TensorRT Inference Server will take advantage of all GPUs on the
server that it has access to. You can limit the GPUs available to the
inference server by using the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES environment
variable (or with Docker you can also use NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES when
launching the container). When using multiple GPUs, the inference
server will distribute inference request across the GPUs to keep them
all equally utilized. You can also :ref:`control more explicitly which
models are running on which GPUs <section-instance-groups>`.

In some deployment and orchestration environments (for example,
Kubernetes) it may be more desirable to partition a single multi-GPU
server into multiple *nodes*, each with one GPU. In this case the
orchestration environment will run a different inference server for
each GPU and an load balancer will be used to divide inference
requests across the available inference server instances.
