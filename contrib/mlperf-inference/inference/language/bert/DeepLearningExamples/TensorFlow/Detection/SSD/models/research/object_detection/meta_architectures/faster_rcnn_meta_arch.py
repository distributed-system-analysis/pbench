"""Faster R-CNN meta-architecture definition.

General tensorflow implementation of Faster R-CNN detection models.

See Faster R-CNN: Ren, Shaoqing, et al.
"Faster R-CNN: Towards real-time object detection with region proposal
networks." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2015.

We allow for three modes: number_of_stages={1, 2, 3}. In case of 1 stage,
all of the user facing methods (e.g., predict, postprocess, loss) can be used as
if the model consisted only of the RPN, returning class agnostic proposals
(these can be thought of as approximate detections with no associated class
information).  In case of 2 stages, proposals are computed, then passed
through a second stage "box classifier" to yield (multi-class) detections.
Finally, in case of 3 stages which is only used during eval, proposals are
computed, then passed through a second stage "box classifier" that will compute
refined boxes and classes, and then features are pooled from the refined and
non-maximum suppressed boxes and are passed through the box classifier again. If
number of stages is 3 during training it will be reduced to two automatically.

Implementations of Faster R-CNN models must define a new
FasterRCNNFeatureExtractor and override three methods: `preprocess`,
`_extract_proposal_features` (the first stage of the model), and
`_extract_box_classifier_features` (the second stage of the model). Optionally,
the `restore_fn` method can be overridden.  See tests for an example.

A few important notes:
+ Batching conventions:  We support batched inference and training where
all images within a batch have the same resolution.  Batch sizes are determined
dynamically via the shape of the input tensors (rather than being specified
directly as, e.g., a model constructor).

A complication is that due to non-max suppression, we are not guaranteed to get
the same number of proposals from the first stage RPN (region proposal network)
for each image (though in practice, we should often get the same number of
proposals).  For this reason we pad to a max number of proposals per image
within a batch. This `self.max_num_proposals` property is set to the
`first_stage_max_proposals` parameter at inference time and the
`second_stage_batch_size` at training time since we subsample the batch to
be sent through the box classifier during training.

For the second stage of the pipeline, we arrange the proposals for all images
within the batch along a single batch dimension.  For example, the input to
_extract_box_classifier_features is a tensor of shape
`[total_num_proposals, crop_height, crop_width, depth]` where
total_num_proposals is batch_size * self.max_num_proposals.  (And note that per
the above comment, a subset of these entries correspond to zero paddings.)

+ Coordinate representations:
Following the API (see model.DetectionModel definition), our outputs after
postprocessing operations are always normalized boxes however, internally, we
sometimes convert to absolute --- e.g. for loss computation.  In particular,
anchors and proposal_boxes are both represented as absolute coordinates.

Images are resized in the `preprocess` method.

The Faster R-CNN meta architecture has two post-processing methods
`_postprocess_rpn` which is applied after first stage and
`_postprocess_box_classifier` which is applied after second stage. There are
three different ways post-processing can happen depending on number_of_stages
configured in the meta architecture:

1. When number_of_stages is 1:
  `_postprocess_rpn` is run as part of the `postprocess` method where
  true_image_shapes is used to clip proposals, perform non-max suppression and
  normalize them.
2. When number of stages is 2:
  `_postprocess_rpn` is run as part of the `_predict_second_stage` method where
  `resized_image_shapes` is used to clip proposals, perform non-max suppression
  and normalize them. In this case `postprocess` method skips `_postprocess_rpn`
  and only runs `_postprocess_box_classifier` using `true_image_shapes` to clip
  detections, perform non-max suppression and normalize them.
3. When number of stages is 3:
  `_postprocess_rpn` is run as part of the `_predict_second_stage` using
  `resized_image_shapes` to clip proposals, perform non-max suppression and
  normalize them. Subsequently, `_postprocess_box_classifier` is run as part of
  `_predict_third_stage` using `true_image_shapes` to clip detections, peform
  non-max suppression and normalize them. In this case, the `postprocess` method
  skips both `_postprocess_rpn` and `_postprocess_box_classifier`.

    Args:
      is_training: A boolean indicating whether the training version of the
        computation graph should be constructed.
      num_classes: Number of classes.  Note that num_classes *does not*
        include the background category, so if groundtruth labels take values
        in {0, 1, .., K-1}, num_classes=K (and not K+1, even though the
        assigned classification targets can range from {0,... K}).
      image_resizer_fn: A callable for image resizing.  This callable
        takes a rank-3 image tensor of shape [height, width, channels]
        (corresponding to a single image), an optional rank-3 instance mask
        tensor of shape [num_masks, height, width] and returns a resized rank-3

        [height, width, channels] containing the size of the true image, as the
        image resizer can perform zero padding. See protos/image_resizer.proto.
      feature_extractor: A FasterRCNNFeatureExtractor object.
      number_of_stages:  An integer values taking values in {1, 2, 3}. If
        1, the function will construct only the Region Proposal Network (RPN)
        part of the model. If 2, the function will perform box refinement and
        other auxiliary predictions all in the second stage. If 3, it will
        extract features from refined boxes and perform the auxiliary
        predictions on the non-maximum suppressed refined boxes.
        If is_training is true and the value of number_of_stages is 3, it is
        reduced to 2 since all the model heads are trained in parallel in second
        stage during training.
      first_stage_anchor_generator: An anchor_generator.AnchorGenerator object
        (note that currently we only support
        grid_anchor_generator.GridAnchorGenerator objects)

        Faster R-CNN (RPN).
      first_stage_atrous_rate: A single integer indicating the atrous rate for
        the single convolution op which is applied to the `rpn_features_to_crop`
        tensor to obtain a tensor to be used for box prediction. Some feature
        extractors optionally allow for producing feature maps computed at
        denser resolutions.  The atrous rate is used to compensate for the
        denser feature maps by using an effectively larger receptive field.
        (This should typically be set to 1).
      first_stage_box_predictor_arg_scope_fn: A function to construct tf-slim
        arg_scope for conv2d, separable_conv2d and fully_connected ops for the
        RPN box predictor.
      first_stage_box_predictor_kernel_size: Kernel size to use for the
        convolution op just prior to RPN box predictions.
      first_stage_box_predictor_depth: Output depth for the convolution op
        just prior to RPN box predictions.
      first_stage_minibatch_size: The "batch size" to use for computing the
        objectness and location loss of the region proposal network. This
        "batch size" refers to the number of anchors selected as contributing
        to the loss function for any given image within the image batch and is
        only called "batch_size" due to terminology from the Faster R-CNN paper.
      first_stage_sampler: Sampler to use for first stage loss (RPN loss).
      first_stage_non_max_suppression_fn: batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression
        callable that takes `boxes`, `scores` and optional `clip_window`(with
        all other inputs already set) and returns a dictionary containing
        tensors with keys: `detection_boxes`, `detection_scores`,
        `detection_classes`, `num_detections`. This is used to perform non max
        suppression  on the boxes predicted by the Region Proposal Network
        (RPN).
        See `post_processing.batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression` for the type
        and shape of these tensors.
      first_stage_max_proposals: Maximum number of boxes to retain after
        performing Non-Max Suppression (NMS) on the boxes predicted by the
        Region Proposal Network (RPN).
      first_stage_localization_loss_weight: A float
      first_stage_objectness_loss_weight: A float

        proposal features.
      initial_crop_size: A single integer indicating the output size
        (width and height are set to be the same) of the initial bilinear
        interpolation based cropping during ROI pooling.
      maxpool_kernel_size: A single integer indicating the kernel size of the
        max pool op on the cropped feature map during ROI pooling.
      maxpool_stride: A single integer indicating the stride of the max pool
        op on the cropped feature map during ROI pooling.
      second_stage_target_assigner: Target assigner to use for second stage of
        Faster R-CNN. If the model is configured with multiple prediction heads,
        this target assigner is used to generate targets for all heads (with the
        correct `unmatched_class_label`).
      second_stage_mask_rcnn_box_predictor: Mask R-CNN box predictor to use for
        the second stage.
      second_stage_batch_size: The batch size used for computing the
        classification and refined location loss of the box classifier.  This
        "batch size" refers to the number of proposals selected as contributing
        to the loss function for any given image within the image batch and is
        only called "batch_size" due to terminology from the Faster R-CNN paper.
      second_stage_sampler:  Sampler to use for second stage loss (box
        classifier loss).
      second_stage_non_max_suppression_fn: batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression
        callable that takes `boxes`, `scores`, optional `clip_window` and
        optional (kwarg) `mask` inputs (with all other inputs already set)
        and returns a dictionary containing tensors with keys:
        `detection_boxes`, `detection_scores`, `detection_classes`,
        `num_detections`, and (optionally) `detection_masks`. See
        `post_processing.batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression` for the type and
        shape of these tensors.
      second_stage_score_conversion_fn: Callable elementwise nonlinearity
        (that takes tensors as inputs and returns tensors).  This is usually
        used to convert logits to probabilities.
      second_stage_localization_loss_weight: A float indicating the scale factor
        for second stage localization loss.
      second_stage_classification_loss_weight: A float indicating the scale
        factor for second stage classification loss.
      second_stage_classification_loss: Classification loss used by the second
        stage classifier. Either losses.WeightedSigmoidClassificationLoss or
        losses.WeightedSoftmaxClassificationLoss.
      second_stage_mask_prediction_loss_weight: A float indicating the scale
        factor for second stage mask prediction loss. This is applicable only if
        second stage box predictor is configured to predict masks.
      hard_example_miner:  A losses.HardExampleMiner object (can be None).
      parallel_iterations: (Optional) The number of iterations allowed to run
        in parallel for calls to tf.map_fn.
      add_summaries: boolean (default: True) controlling whether summary ops
        should be added to tensorflow graph.
      clip_anchors_to_image: Normally, anchors generated for a given image size
        are pruned during training if they lie outside the image window. This
        option clips the anchors to be within the image instead of pruning.
      use_static_shapes: If True, uses implementation of ops with static shape
        guarantees.
      resize_masks: Indicates whether the masks presend in the groundtruth
        should be resized in the model with `image_resizer_fn`

    Raises:
      ValueError: If `second_stage_batch_size` > `first_stage_max_proposals` at
        training time.

    """Computes scalar box classifier loss tensors.

    Uses self._detector_target_assigner to obtain regression and classification
    targets for the second stage box classifier, optionally performs
    hard mining, and returns losses.  All losses are computed independently
    for each image and then averaged across the batch.
    Please note that for boxes and masks with multiple labels, the box
    regression and mask prediction losses are only computed for one label.

    This function assumes that the proposal boxes in the "padded" regions are
    actually zero (and thus should not be matched to).


    Args:

        [total_num_proposals, num_classes, box_coder.code_size] representing
        predicted (final) refined box encodings. If using a shared box across
        classes this will instead have shape
        [total_num_proposals, 1, box_coder.code_size].
      class_predictions_with_background: a 2-D tensor with shape
        [total_num_proposals, num_classes + 1] containing class
        predictions (logits) for each of the anchors.  Note that this tensor
        *includes* background class predictions (at class index 0).
      proposal_boxes: [batch_size, self.max_num_proposals, 4] representing
        decoded proposal bounding boxes.
      num_proposals: A Tensor of type `int32`. A 1-D tensor of shape [batch]
        representing the number of proposals predicted for each image in
        the batch.
      groundtruth_boxlists: a list of BoxLists containing coordinates of the
        groundtruth boxes.
      groundtruth_classes_with_background_list: a list of 2-D one-hot
        (or k-hot) tensors of shape [num_boxes, num_classes + 1] containing the
        class targets with the 0th index assumed to map to the background class.
      groundtruth_weights_list: A list of 1-D tf.float32 tensors of shape
        [num_boxes] containing weights for groundtruth boxes.
      image_shape: a 1-D tensor of shape [4] representing the image shape.
      prediction_masks: an optional 4-D tensor with shape [total_num_proposals,
        num_classes, mask_height, mask_width] containing the instance masks for
        each box.
      groundtruth_masks_list: an optional list of 3-D tensors of shape
        [num_boxes, image_height, image_width] containing the instance masks for
        each of the boxes.
      detection_boxes: 3-D float tensor of shape [batch,
        max_total_detections, 4] containing post-processed detection boxes in
        normalized co-ordinates.
      num_detections: 1-D int32 tensor of shape [batch] containing number of
