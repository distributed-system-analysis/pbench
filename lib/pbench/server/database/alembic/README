Generic single-database configuration.

Some useful commands to run migrations:

Migration commit files are stored in alembic/versions folder.

To create a db migration file
# alembic revision — autogenerate -m “First commit”

Using the above command alembic generates our first migration commit file in versions folder.
File names are usually stored as revision_id_<commit_message>.py

Once this file is generated we are ready for database migration.
# alembic upgrade head

To upgrade to a specific revision
# alembic upgrade <revision_id_>

To downgrade to a specific revision
# alembic downgrade <revision_id_>

Generally you should run alembic within a Pbench CI container tox environment, using
the wrapper command which orchestrates the PostgreSQL container:
# EXTRA_PODMAN_SWITCHES="--network host" WORKSPACE_TMP=${HOME} jenkins/run tox -e alembic-migration -- create

Make sure you don't already have a local PostgreSQL container (e.g., from `runlocal`)
