# How to use perf tools locally
#
# The pbench "perf" tool ends up creating a perf.data.xz and perf.data.tar.bz2 file.
# The system on which this file was created may no longer be accessible to you when
# viewing perf data in a pbench tar ball.  However, you can still process the perf
# data on your local system.
#
# Copy both files to your local system:
#
# $ curl -X GET -o ./perf.data.xz      <URL>/perf.data.xz
# $ curl -X GET -o ./perf.data.tar.bz2 <URL>/perf.data.tar.bz2
#
# Then unpack the perf.data.tar.bz2 file in a .debug directory as a sub-directory
# of the user's home directory:
#
# $ mkdir -p $HOME/.debug
# $ tar xf ./perf.data.tar.bz2 -C $HOME/.debug
#
# Then run perf report on the data file as normal:
#
# $ unxz ./perf.data.xz
# $ perf report -i ./perf.data
#
# The presence of that $HOME/.debug directory will be picked up by perf report and
# the symbols in the perf.data file will be resolved with the stored data in the
# $HOME/.debug directory.
