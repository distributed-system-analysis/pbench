# this script is to be used *only* in a post-trans action
# by an "internal" RPM. It installs the ssh private key
# file to allow pbench to move/copy results to the server.

# Usage: pbench-agent-config-ssh-key <path/to/pbench-agent.cfg> <path/to/local/private/key>

# This script installs the local config file that is used by the
# scripts to discover local settings. One of these is the results
# server that move-results uses to copy results to. The move-results
# script uses scp to do that under the user id "pbench". The private
# key for that user, as given by the second argument to this script,
# is copied to the place where move-results expects it.
