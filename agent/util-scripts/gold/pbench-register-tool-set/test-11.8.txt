+++ Running test-11.8 pbench-register-tool-set --remotes=one.example.com,two.example.com --labels=labelOne
[error][1900-01-01T00:00:00.000000] The number of labels given, " --labels=labelOne", does not match the number of remotes given, " --remotes=one.example.com,two.example.com"
usage:
pbench-register-tool-set --toolset=<tool-set> [--group=<group-name>] [--interval=<interval>] [--no-install] [--remotes=<remote-host>[,<remote-host>]] [--labels=<label>[,<label>]]
pbench-register-tool-set --toolset=<tool-set> [--group=<group-name>] [--interval=<interval>] [--no-install] [--remotes=@<remotes-file>]

	Where the list of labels must match the list of remotes.

	One can specify as the argument to the "--remotes" option a single
	remote host, a list of remote hosts (comma-separated, no spaces) or an
	"at" sign ("@") followed by a filename.  In this last case, the file
	should contain a list of hosts and their (optional) labels.  Each line
	of the file should contain a host name, optionally followed by a label
	separated by a comma (","); empty lines are ignored, and comments are
	denoted by a leading hash, or pound ("#"), character.
