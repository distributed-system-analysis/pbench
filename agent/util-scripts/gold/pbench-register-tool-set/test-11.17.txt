usage:
pbench-register-tool-set [--toolset=<tool-set>] [--group=<group-name>] [--interval=<interval>] [--no-install] [--remotes=<remote-host>[,<remote-host>]] [--labels=<label>[,<label>]] [<tool-set>]
pbench-register-tool-set [--toolset=<tool-set>] [--group=<group-name>] [--interval=<interval>] [--no-install] [--remotes=@<remotes-file>] [<tool-set>]

	Where the list of labels must match the list of remotes.

	One can specify as the argument to the "--remotes" option a single
	remote host, a list of remote hosts (comma-separated, no spaces) or an
	"at" sign ("@") followed by a filename.  In this last case, the file
	should contain a list of hosts and their (optional) labels.  Each line
	of the file should contain a host name, optionally followed by a label
	separated by a comma (","); empty lines are ignored, and comments are
	denoted by a leading hash, or pound ("#"), character.

Available tool sets from /var/tmp/pbench-test-utils/opt/pbench-agent/config/pbench-agent.cfg:

	legacy
