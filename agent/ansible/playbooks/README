* Ansible playbooks to install pbench-agent

The basic playbook is pbench_agent_install.yml which

  - installs the pbench agent repo.
  - installs the pbench-agent RPM.
  - installs the config file(s)
  - installs the ssh key file.

Two other playbooks are subsets of this one: pbench-repo-install.yml
performs the first step only; pbench-agent-config.yml performs the
last two steps only.

N.B. Installation is incomplete until we install a key file so that
=pbench=-move/copy-results= can move/copy results to the server and a
config file so that it knows which server to use.

The playbooks use variables defined in the inventory file (for an
example inventory file, see =./pbench-agent.hosts.example=).
It must be modified for a given environment: see comments in the
file for guidance.

* Usage
#+begin_src shell
ansible-playbook -i /path/to/inventory/pbench-agent.hosts pbench_agent_install.yml
#+end_src


* Installing roles from Ansible Galaxy

The roles that the above playbooks use are available from Ansible
Galaxy, as part of the pbench.agent collection. You can install the
collection with

   ansible-galaxy collection install pbench.agent

The roles will be installed under

    $HOME/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/pbench/agent

and you will need to add this path to Ansible's roles path in order
for the playbooks to find them:

    ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=$HOME/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/pbench/agent/roles:$ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH
    export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH

or, more permanently, you can add it to the /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
file:

You will still need a playbook to install the pbench agent. You can use the
standard pbench_agent_install.yml from the pbench repo - here's a link:

    https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/ansible/pbench_agent_install.yml

If you want to wget/curl the file, use the raw link:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/master/agent/ansible/pbench_agent_install.yml

Once the dust settles a bit, we will probably move the playbooks to Galaxy
as well.

* Installing the roles *TO* Ansible Galaxy

- Update the version in pbench/agent/galaxy.yml: for bug fixes,
  increment the last of the three numbers; for new functionality that
  leaves things backwards-compatible, increment the middle of the
  three numbers; for incompatible updates, increment the first number.

- `make test' and make sure that there are no blocking errors/warning.

- `make publish' to publish the new version on Ansible Galaxy: you
  need to have an account on Galaxy and your account needs to have
  admin privileges to the `pbench' namespace.

Prereqs:

- an account on galaxy.ansible.com - typically, one can use a GitHub account for a Galaxy account.

- admin access to the "pbench" namespace. Whoever has admin access
  to the namespace currently can add new members.

- an API key. You can get that from the user preferences while you are
  logged in at the Galaxy site.

The Makefile assumes that the API key is available as the value
of the environment variable APIKEY.
