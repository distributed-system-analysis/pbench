* Ansible playbook to install key and config file

We assume that the pbench-agent code has been installed (through a
package or some other method). That installation is incomplete until
we install a key file so that =pbench=-move/copy-results= can
move/copy results to the server and a config file so that it knows
which server to use.

The =pbench-agent-config.yml= playbook does that, by using variables
defined in the inventory file (for an example inventory file, see
=Inventory/pbench-agent.hosts=).

* Usage
#+begin_src shell
ansible-playbook -i Inventory/pbench-agent.hosts pbench-agent-config.yml
#+end_src
