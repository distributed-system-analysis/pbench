* Ansible playbooks to install pbench-agent

The basic playbook is pbench-agent-install.yml which

  - installs the pbench agent repo.
  - installs the pbench-agent RPM.
  - installs the config file(s)
  - installs the ssh key file.

Two other playbooks are subsets of this one: pbench-repo-install.yml
performs the first step only; pbench-agent-config.yml performs the
last two steps only.

N.B. Installation is incomplete until we install a key file so that
=pbench=-move/copy-results= can move/copy results to the server and a
config file so that it knows which server to use.

The playbooks use variables defined in the inventory file (for an
example inventory file, see =Inventory/pbench-agent.hosts.example=).
It must be modified for a given environment: see comments in the
file for guidance.

* Usage
#+begin_src shell
ansible-playbook -i /path/to/inventory/pbench-agent.hosts pbench-agent-install.yml
#+end_src
