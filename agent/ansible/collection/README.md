# Ansible Collection - pbench.agent

The roles in this collection allow the installation of the pbench-agent RPM and related RPMs, and the configuration of the agent for use in a particular environment.

More information about pbench can be found at https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench.

The roles assume that the following variables are defined:

- pbench_repo_url_prefix: the repo where the RPMs can be found (default: https://copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org/results/ndokos).
- pbench_config_url: the location where one or more config files can be obtained (default: none).
- pbench_config_dest: the location within the pbench-agent installation directory where the config file is going to be copied (default: /opt/pbench-agent/config/)
- pbench_config_files: a list of config files to be installed on an agent (default: '["pbench-agent.cfg"]').
- pbench_key_url: the location where an ssh key can be obtained for sending results to a server (default: none).
- pbench_key_dest: the location within the pbench-agent installation directory where the key is going to be copied. (default: /opt/pbench-agent/).

Some of these are defaulted for convenience, but pbench_repo_url_prefix and pbench_key_url are specific to an environment and need to be specified locally (most likely in the inventory file).

An example playbook can be obtained from

or you can use the raw link to wget/curl the file:

An example inventory file that can be edited to suit your circumstances can be obtained from
