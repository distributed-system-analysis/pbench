* Introduction
These are the bits of Javascript, CSS and such that are necessary to render
the graphs that pbench produces. They are packaged up in an RPM for easy installation.
The RPM is used by the pbench server installation, but it can also be used to
allow viewing of pbench graphs locally. This is what is described in this document.

* Installation
The RPM is available from the standard pbench repo on COPR. If you
have a pbench-agent installed already, the repo should be already
available. If not, consult the [[file:../agent/installation.org::*External%20repo][PBench agent installation instructions]]
for details.

Once the repo is installed, the RPM itself can be installed with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dnf install pbench-web-server
# or ...
yum install pbench-web-server
#+END_EXAMPLE
The RPM defines a =post-trans= action that uses the =Node.js= package
manager =npm= to install various Javascript libraries, in particular
=d3= and =nvd3=. The RPM requires the =npm= package, so if it is not
installed already, it will be installed as a dependency[fn:1]. The action
then calls =npm install= on the various packages.

[fn:1] RHEL[6,7] requires the addition of the [[https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL][EPEL]] repo in order to be
able to get the npm package. 

* Local configuration
It is assumed that you have an HTTP server installed and running. Here
I will assume =apache=, but similar considerations apply to other servers.

The HTTP server will need access to the JS/CSS files that the pbench HTML
files require: these are assumed to reside in a subdirectory of the document
root of the server, called =static=. Assuming that the document root is
the default =/var/www/html=, the easiest way to accomplish that is to
plant a symlink in the document root that points to the installed =static=
directory:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ln -sf /opt/pbench-web-server/html/static /var/www/html
#+END_EXAMPLE

In addition, you will need to bring the =pbench-agent= data directory
into the purview of the server. Again, a symlink is the simplest solution:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ln -sf /var/lib/pbench-agent /var/www/html
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Viewing pbench data locally

Now browse to
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
http://localhost/pbench-agent
#+END_EXAMPLE
You should be able view graphs on you local system the same way that you can
view graphs on the pbench server.
