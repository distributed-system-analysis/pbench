* Running unit tests using the travis-ci infrastructure at github.

The unit tests require bash, perl (for the postprocessing scripts)
and python for the indexing unit tests.

The travis-ci hosts are set up with Ubunty 12.04 LTS, with some additions.
That works fine for bash and perl - the .travis.yml file was taking care
of different perl versions like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
language: perl
perl:
 - "5.20"
 - "5.18"
 - "5.16"
 - "5.10"
install:
 - sudo apt-get install python python-pip bc libjson-perl realpath
 - sudo pip install configtools
script:
 - ./agent/bench-scripts/unittests
 - ./agent/tool-scripts/postprocess/unittests
 - ./bgtasks/pbench/bin/unittests
#+END_EXAMPLE

That causes travis-ci to run the same unit tests four times, once for
each version of perl, but that accommodates all the perl versions running
on RHEL6/7 or recent Fedora versions.

* Python dependencies 
The indexing tests run the index-pbench script which requires python
>= 3.3.  The main reason for that is that the tarfile.py module does
not handle xz-compressed tarballs before that version. There is also
a minor dependency on FileNotFoundError which was introduced in python 3.3,
but that can be easily worked around. The tarfile.py dependency can also
be worked around of course, at the price of introducing a compatibility layer
(something which we did for other projects), but it seems wasteful to do
that in this case and in the future. We hope that at some point the travis-ci
infrastructure will use a more modern distro, one with a built-in (or easily
available) python >= 3.3 (at the time of writing, this looks like python 3.5).

For the time being, we go through a bunch of hoops and install python 3.4 on
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

language: perl
perl:
 - "5.20"
 - "5.18"
 - "5.16"
 - "5.10"
install:
 - sudo apt-get install python python-pip bc libjson-perl realpath
 - sudo pip install configtools elasticsearch
 - sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
 - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes -y
 - sudo apt-get update
 - sudo apt-get install python3.4
 - sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
 - sudo easy_install3 pip
 - sudo pip3 install configtools elasticsearch
 - sudo cp -r /usr/local/lib/python3.2/dist-packages/* /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages
 - sudo ln -sf python3.4 /usr/bin/python3
script:
 - ./agent/bench-scripts/unittests
 - ./agent/tool-scripts/postprocess/unittests
 - ./bgtasks/pbench/bin/unittests
#+END_EXAMPLE

python-software-properties provides the add-apt-repository command
that is used to add the fkrull/deadsnakes ppa.

There are no official repos for python > 3.2 for Ubuntu 12.04. The
best I could find was the fkrull/deadsnakes PPA which provides
unofficial packages of more recent python versions.

To install configtools and elasticsearch in the python3.4 package
directory, we have to install pip3, using easy_install3, which in turn
is installed using python3-setuptools.  The packages are installed
under python3.2 however, so we copy them to the python3.4 directory by
hand. We also symlink /usr/bin/python3 to the python3.4 version.

With these additions, python3.4 is installed and the indexing unit tests
are now passing.
