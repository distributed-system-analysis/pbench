* How to get them

Download the repo file
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/pbench-test.repo http://repohost.example.com/test-repo/yum.repos.d/pbench-test.repo
#+END_EXAMPLE
and enable it (it's not enabled by default). You can invoke yum with
the --enable-repo switch to enable the repo for that invocation only;
e.g.:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yum update --enable-repo=pbench-test pbench
#+END_EXAMPLE
If yum refuses to update, you might have to clean the yum cache. If
the version number of the test version is such that yum will not
update it under any circumstances, you might have to erase your current
installed pbench rpm, clean the yum cache and install using the full
VERSION-RELEASE designation:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yum erase pbench
yum clean expire-cache
yum install --enable-repo=pbench-test pbench-0.31-<mumble>
#+END_EXAMPLE
After testing, erase the pbench package if necessary and reinstall the
latest official version.
