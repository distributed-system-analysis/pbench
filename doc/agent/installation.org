* Introduction

The pbench agent requires the installation of some generic bits, but it
also requires some localization: it needs to know where to send the results
for storage and analysis and it needs to be able to authenticate to the
storage server.

The generic bits are packaged as an RPM, available from COPR
([[https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/]]). We try to build a new release
every month or so.

The localization bits are of course, specific to a particular
installation.  Internally, we make them available to users through an
internal RPM, but other installations may use different methods to
make them available. Consult your local pbench guru for help.

In the following, we describe how to install =pbench-agent= using the
two RPMs (the "external" RPM and the "internal" RPM). You will have to
modify these instructions for *your* local installation. Nevertheless,
for simplicity, in the following we will refer to the two packages as
=pbench-agent= and =pbench-agent-internal=, but bear in mind that your
local installation may use different names or may not use an internal
RPM or may not use RPMs at all.

Note that the same =pbench-agent= version *must* be installed on all the
test systems that participate in a benchmark run: there is *no support
for mixed installations*.

* Repos

You will need to install both the external repo and (if applicable)
the internal repo on every machine where you are planning to run
=pbench= (including VMs).  N.B. These steps must be run as =root=.

** External repo

If your system supports =dnf=, then you can copy the repo locally with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dnf copr enable ndokos/pbench
#+END_EXAMPLE
If your system only supports =yum=, you may be able to install the COPR plugin
and install similarly:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yum install yum-plugin-copr
yum copr enable ndokos/pbench
#+END_EXAMPLE
If all else fails, you can manually download the repo, by visiting
[[https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ndokos/pbench/]] and clicking
on the appropriate repo (Epel 6, Epel 7, Fedora 22 or Fedora 23).
Save it into =/etc/yum.repos.d/ndokos-pbench.repo=. Or use e.g. =wget=:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/_copr_ndokos-pbench.repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ndokos/pbench/repo/epel-6/ndokos-pbench-epel-6.repo
#+END_EXAMPLE
for a RHEL6 or Centos 6 system.

** Internal repo                                                   :external:

Refer to your local installation guide or ask your local pbench guru for help.

If there is no such repo, you will need to install the =pbench-agent= RPM and
then manually install the config file and the pbench private key which will allow
you to send results to the server. Refer to [[*Installing =pbench-agent=][Installing =pbench-agent=]] below.

* Package dependencies
In order to simplify installation, the =pbench-agent= RPM requires the
installation of a few tools that should be available from the distribution's
standard repo(s), plus one package (=configtools=) that is available from
the external repo above.

* Installing =pbench-agent=                                        :external:
Once you have the COPR repo installed, you can install the =pbench-agent= RPM
and source the startup file to initialize your PATH and CONFIG environment
variables:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dnf install pbench-agent
. /etc/profile.d/pbench-agent.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE
The =pbench-agent= RPM is *not* self-contained.  You will need to
somehow be given access to the config file and the pbench ssh private
key for your installation. They may be part of another RPM, or you may
be able to copy them from a central location or from media that your
administrator provides.

You can install these two as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cfg=/path/to/config/file/pbench-agent.cfg
pbench-agent-config-activate $cfg
pbench-agent-config-ssh-key $cfg /path/to/pbench/private/key/id_rsa
#+END_EXAMPLE
You should be ready to roll.

* Administrator responsibility: Config file and ssh private key file :external:
If you are the administrator for this installation, you will have to
create a config file and make it available to your users. How you make
it available is up to you. This section describes how to create the config file
in the first place.

The installation includes an example config file at
=/opt/pbench-agent/config/pbench-agent.cfg.example=. Copy this file to
a safe place and rename it to =pbench-agent.cfg=; then edit the lines that
are flagged with =# CHANGE ME!= comments to reflect your setup.

The ssh key pair can be generated with
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ssh-keygen -t rsa
#+END_EXAMPLE
and an empty passphrase. The private key has to be made available to users
so they can complete their installation of =pbench-agent= as described above.
The public key should be added to the =authorized-keys= file of the =pbench=
user on the server where the results are copied.
