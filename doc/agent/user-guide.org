* What is =pbench=?
PBench is a harness that allows data collection from a variety of tools
while running a benchmark. PBench has some built-in script that run some
common benchmarks, but the data collection can be run separately as well
with a benchmark that is not built-in to pbench, or a pbench script can
be written for the benchmark. Such contributions are more than welcome!

* TL;DR - How to set up pbench and run a benchmark                 :external:
Prerequisite: Somebody has already done the server setup.

The following steps assume that only a single node participates in the benchmark run. If you
want a multi-node setup, you have to read up on the =--remote= options of various commands
(in particular, =pbench-register-tool-set=):
- [[file:installation.org][Install the agent]].
- Customize the agent for your server environment. This will vary from
  installation to installation, but it fundamentally involves copying
  two files that should be made available to you somehow by an admin
  type: an ssh private key file to allow the client(s) to send results
  to the server and a configuration file that should be installed in
  =/opt/pbench-agent/config/pbench-agent.cfg=. There is an example
  configuration file in that location, but you need the "real" one for
  your environment. Among other things, the config file specifies who
  the server is.
- Run your benchmark with a default set of tools:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  . /etc/profile.d/pbench-agent.sh                          # or log out and log back in
  pbench-register-tool-set
  pbench-user-benchmark -C test1 -- ./your_cmd.sh
  pbench-move-results
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- Visit the Results URL in your browser to see the results: the URL
  depends on who the server is; assuming that the server is
  "pbench.example.com" and assuming you ran the above on a host named
  "myhost", the results will be found at (*N.B.*: this is a fake link
  serving as an example only - talk to your local administrator to find out
  what server to use to get to pbench results):
  [[http://pbench.example.com/results/myhost/pbench-user-benchmark_test1_yyyy-mm-dd_HH:MM:SS]].

For explanations and details, see subsequent sections.

* How to install
See  the [[file:./installation.org][installation instructions]].

* First steps
All of the commands take a =--help= option and produce a terse
usage message.

The default set of tools for data collection can be enabled with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-register-tool-set
#+END_EXAMPLE

You can then run a built-in benchmark by invoking its pbench script -
pbench will install the benchmark if necessary[fn:1]:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-fio
#+END_EXAMPLE
When the benchmark finishes, the tools will be stopped as well. The
results can be collected and shipped to the standard storage location[fn:2]
with:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-move-results
#+END_EXAMPLE
or
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-copy-results
#+END_EXAMPLE

[fn:1] The current version of pbench-agent yum installs prebuilt RPMs of
various common benchmarks: dbench, fio, iozone, linpack, smallfile and uperf,
as well as the most recent version of the sysstat tools. We are planning to
add more benchmarks to the list: iperf, netperf, streams, maybe the phoronix
benchmarks. If you want some other benchmark (AIM7?), let us know.

[fn:2] The "standard storage location" is site-dependent. Check with the admin
who set up the pbench server at your site.

** First steps with pbench-user-benchmark
If you want to run something that is not already packaged up as a benchmark script,
you may be able to use the =pbench-user-benchmark= script: it takes a command as argument,
starts the collection tools, invokes the command, stops the collection tools and
postprocesses the results. So the workflow becomes:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-register-tool-set
pbench-user-benchmark --config=foo -- myscript.sh
pbench-move-results
#+END_EXAMPLE
See [[*What does =--config= do?][What does =--config= do?]] for more information on that.

** First steps with remote hosts and pbench-user-benchmark
Running a multihost benchmark involves registering the tools on all the hosts,
but assuming you have a script that will execute your benchmark that can be
used with =pbench-user-benchmark=, the workflow is not much different:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for host in $hosts ;do
    pbench-register-tool-set --remote=$host
done
pbench-user-benchmark --config=foo -- myscript.sh
pbench-move-results
#+END_EXAMPLE
Apart from having to register the collection tools on *all* the hosts, the rest
is the same: =pbench-user-benchmark= will start the collection tools on all the hosts,
run =myscript.sh=, stop the tools and run the postprocessing phase, gathering up
all the remote results to the local host (the local host may be just a controller,
not running any collection tools itself, or it may be part of the set of hosts where
the benchmark is run, with collection tools running).

The underlying assumption is that =myscript.sh= will run your
benchmark on all the relevant hosts and will copy all the results into
the standard directory which postprocessing will copy over to the
controller host. =pbench-user-benchmark= calls the script in its command-line
arguments (everything after the -- is just execed by =-pbench-user-benchmark=)
and redirects its =stdout= to a file in that directory:
=$benchmark_run_dir/result.txt=.

* Defaults
The benchmark scripts source the base script (=/opt/pbench-agent/base=)
which sets a bunch of defaults:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench_run=/var/lib/pbench-agent
pbench_log=/var/lib/pbench-agent/pbench.log
date=`date "+%F_%H:%M:%S"`
hostname=`hostname -s`
results_repo=pbench@pbench.example.com
results_repo_dir=/pbench/public_html/incoming
ssh_opts='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
#+END_EXAMPLE

Some of these are now specified in the config file
=/opt/pbench-agent/config/pbench-agent.cfg=.

* Available tools
The configured default set of tools (what you would get by running
=pbench-register-tool-set=) is:
- sar, iostat, mpstat, pidstat, proc-vmstat, proc-interrupts, perf

In addition, there are tools that can be added to the default set
with =pbench-register-tool=:
- blktrace, cpuacct, dm-cache, docker, kvmstat, kvmtrace, lockstat,
  numastat, perf, porc-sched_debug, proc-vmstat, qemu-migrate, rabbit,
  strace, sysfs, systemtap, tcpdump, turbostat, virsh-migrate, vmstat
There is a =default= group of tools (that's what =pbench-register-tool-set= uses), but
tools can be registered in other groups using the =--group= option of =pbench-register-tool=.
The group can then be started and stopped using =pbench-start-tools= and =pbench-stop-tools=
using their =--group= option.

Additional tools can be registered:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-register-tool --name blktrace
#+END_EXAMPLE
or unregistered (e.g. some people prefer to run without perf):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-unregister-tool --name perf
#+END_EXAMPLE
Note that perf is run in a "low overhead" mode with options "record -a
--freq=100", but if you want to run it differently, you can always
unregister it and register it again with different options:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-unregister-tool --name=perf
pbench-register-tool --name=perf -- --record-opts="record -a --freq=200"
#+END_EXAMPLE
Tools can be also be registered, started and stopped on remote hosts
(see the =--remote= option described in [[*What does =--remote= do?][What does =--remote= do?]]).

* Available benchmark scripts

PBench provides a set of pre-packaged script to run some common benchmarks
using the collection tools and other facilities that pbench provides.  These
are found in the =bench-scripts= directory of the pbench installation
(=/opt/pbench-agent/bench-scripts= by default). The current set includes:

- =pbench-dbench=
- =pbench-fio=
- =pbench-linpack=
- =pbench-migrate=
- =pbench-tpcc=
- =pbench-uperf=
- =pbench-user-benchmark= (see [[*Running pbench collection tools with an arbitrary benchmark][Running pbench collection tools with an arbitrary benchmark]] below for more on this)

Note that in many of these scripts the default tool group is hard-wired: if you want them to run
a different tool group, you need to edit the script[fn:4].

[fn:4] That will be handled by a configuration file in the future.

* Utility scripts
This section is needed as preparation for the [[*Second steps][Second steps]] section below.

PBench uses a bunch of utility scripts to do common operations. There
is a common set of options for some of these: =--name= to specify a
tool, =--group= to specify a tool group, =--with-options= to list or
pass options to a tool, =--remote= to operate on a remote host
(see entries in the [[*FAQ][FAQ]] section below for more
details on these options).

The first set is for registering and unregistering tools and getting
some information about them:

- =pbench-list-tools= :: list the tools in the default group or in the
  specified group; with the --name option, list the groups that the
  named tool is in. TBD: how do you list *all* available tools
  whether in a group or not?
- =pbench-register-tool-set= :: call =pbench-register-tool= on each tool in the default list.
- =pbench-register-tool= :: add a tool to a tool group (possibly remotely).
- OBSOLETE (see below)  =pbench-unregister-tool= :: remove a tool from a tool group (possibly remotely).
- =pbench-clear-tools= :: remove a tool or all tools from a specified tool
  group (including remotely). Used with a =--name= option, it replaces =pbench-unregister-tool=.

The second set is for controlling the running of tools --
=pbench-start-tools= and =pbench-stop-tools=, as well as =pbench-postprocess-tools= below,
take =--group=, =--dir= and =--iteration= options: which group of
tools to start/stop/postprocess, which directory to use to stash
results and a label to apply to this set of results. =pbench-kill-tools= is
used to make sure that all running tools are stopped: having a bunch
of tools from earlier runs still running has been know to happen and
is the cause of many problems (slowdowns in particular):

- =pbench-start-tools= :: start a group of tools, stashing the results in the
  directory specified by =--dir=.
- =pbench-stop-tools= :: stop a group of tools.
- =pbench-kill-tools= :: make sure that no tools are running to pollute the
  environment.

The third set is for handling the results and doing cleanup:
- =pbench-postprocess-tools= :: run all the relevant postprocessing scripts
  on the tool output - this step also gathers up tool output from
  remote hosts to the local host in preparation for copying it to
  the results repository.
- =pbench-clear-results= :: start with a clean slate.
- =pbench-copy-results= :: copy results to the results repo.
- =pbench-move-results= :: move the results to the results repo and delete
  them from the local host.
- =pbench-edit-prefix= :: change the directory structure of the results
  (see the [[*Accessing results on the web][Accessing results on the web]] section below for details).
- XXX =pbench-cleanup= :: clean up the pbench run directory - after this step,
  you will need to register any tools again.

=pbench-register-tool-set=, =pbench-register-tool= and =pbench-unregister-tool= can also
take a =--remote= option (see [[*What does =--remote= do?][What does =--remote= do?]]) in order to
allow the starting/stopping of tools and the postprocessing of results
on multiple remote hosts.

There is a set of miscellaneous tools for doing various and
sundry things - although the name of the script indicates its purpose,
if you want more information on these, you will have to read the code:
- =pbench-avg-stddev=
- =pbench-log-timestamp=
These are used by various pieces of pbench. There is also a =contrib=
directory that contains completely unsupported tools that various people
have found useful.

* Second steps

WARNING: It is *highly* recommended that you use one of the =pbench-<benchmark>=
scripts for running your benchmark. If one does not exist already, you might be
able to use the =pbench-user-benchmark= script to run your own script. The advantage
is that these scripts already embody some conventions that pbench and associated
tools depend on, e.g. using a timestamp in the name of the results directory to
make the name unique. If you cannot use =pbench-user-benchmark= and a =pbench-<benchmark>=
script does not exist already, consider writing one or helping us write one. The
more we can encapsulate all these details into generally useful tools, the easier
it will be for everybody: people running it will not need to worry about all these
details and people maintaining the system will not have to fix stuff because the
script broke some assumptions. The easiest way to do so is to crib an existing
=pbench-<benchmark>= script, e.g =pbench-fio=.

Once collection tools have been registered, the work flow of a
benchmark script is as follows:
- Process options (see [[*Benchmark scripts options][Benchmark scripts options]]).
- Check that the necessary prerequisites are installed and if not, install them.
- Iterate over some set of benchmark characteristics
  (e.g. =pbench-fio= iterates over a couple test types: read, randread
  and a bunch of block sizes), with each iteration doing the following:
  - create a benchmark_results directory
  - start the collection tools
  - run the benchmark
  - stop the collection tools
  - postprocess the collection tools data

The tools are started with an invocation of =pbench-start-tools= like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-start-tools --group=$group --iteration=$iteration --dir=$benchmark_tools_dir
#+END_EXAMPLE
where the group is usually "default" but can be changed to taste as
described above, iteration is a benchmark-specific tag that
disambiguates the separate iterations in a run (e.g. for =pbench-fio=
it is a combination of a count, the test type, the block size and a
device name), and the benchmark_tools_dir specifies where the collection
results are going to end up (see the [[*Results structure][Results structure]] section for much
more detail on this).

The stop invocation is exactly parallel, as is the postprocessing invocation:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-stop-tools --group=$group --iteration=$iteration --dir=$benchmark_tools_dir
pbench-postprocess-tools --group=$group --iteration=$iteration --dir=$benchmark_tools_dir
#+END_EXAMPLE


** Benchmark scripts options

Generally speaking, benchmark scripts do not take any pbench-specific
options except =--config= (see [[*What does =--config= do?][What does =--config= do?]]  below).
Other options tend to be benchmark-specific[fn:5].

[fn:5] It is probably better to bundle these options in a configuration file,
but that's still WIP.

** Collection tools options

=--help= can be used to trigger the usage message on all of the tools (even though it's
an invalid option for many of them). Here is a list of gotcha's:

- blktrace: you need to pass =--devices=/dev/sda,/dev/sdb= when you register the tool:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  pbench-register-tool --name=blktrace [--remote=foo] -- --devices=/dev/sda,/dev/sdb
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  There is no default and leaving it empty causes errors in
  postprocessing (this should be flagged).

** Utility script options

Note that =pbench-move-results=, =pbench-copy-results= and =pbench-clear-results= always
assume that the run directory is the default =/var/lib/pbench-agent=.

=pbench-move-results= and =pbench-copy-results= now (starting with pbench version 0.31-108gf016ed6)
take a =--prefix= option. This is explained in the [[*Accessing results on the web][Accessing results on the web]] section
below.

Note also that =pbench-start/stop/postprocess-tools= *must* be called with exactly the same
arguments. The built-in benchmark scripts do that already, but if you go your own way,
make sure to follow this dictum.

- =--dir= :: specify the run directory for all the collections tools. This argument
  *must* be used by =pbench-start/stop/postprocess-tools=, so that all the results files
  are in known places:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  pbench-start-tools --dir=/var/lib/pbench-agent/foo
  pbench-stop-tools  --dir=/var/lib/pbench-agent/foo
  pbench-postprocess-tools --dir=/var/lib/pbench-agent/foo
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- =--remote= :: specify a remote host on which a collection tools (or set of collection tools)
  is to be registered:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  pbench-register-tool --name=<tool> --remote=<host>
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* Running pbench collection tools with an arbitrary benchmark


If you want to take advantage of pbench's data collection and other
goodies, but your benchmark is not part of the set above (see [[*Available benchmark scripts][Available benchmark scripts]]),
or you want to run it differently so
that the pre-packaged script does not work for you, that's no problem
(but, if possible, heed the [[*Second steps][WARNING]] above). The various pbench phases
can be run separately and you can fit your benchmark into the
appropriate slot:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
group=default
benchmark_tools_dir=TBD

pbench-register-tool-set --group=$group
pbench-start-tools --group=$group --iteration=$iteration --dir=$benchmark_tools_dir
<run your benchmark>
pbench-stop-tools --group=$group --iteration=$iteration --dir=$benchmark_tools_dir
pbench-postprocess-tools --group=$group --iteration=$iteration --dir=$benchmark_tools_dir
pbench-copy-results
#+END_EXAMPLE
Often, multiple experiments (or "iterations") are run as part of a single run. The modified
flow then looks like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
group=default
experiments="exp1 exp2 exp3"
benchmark_tools_dir=TBD

pbench-register-tool-set --group=$group
for exp in $experiments ;do
    pbench-start-tools --group=$group --iteration=$exp
    <run the experiment>
    pbench-stop-tools --group=$group --iteration=$exp
    pbench-postprocess-tools --group=$group --iteration=$exp
done
pbench-copy-results
#+END_EXAMPLE

Alternatively, you may be able to use the =pbench-user-benchmark= script as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-user-benchmark --config="specjbb2005-4-JVMs" -- my_benchmark.sh
#+END_EXAMPLE
which is going to run =my_benchmark.sh= in the =<run your benchmark>=
slot above. Iterations and such are your responsibility.

=pbench-user-benchmark= can also be used for a somewhat more specialized
scenario: sometimes you just want to run the collection tools for a
short time while your benchmark is running to get an idea of how the
system looks. The idea here is to use =pbench-user-benchmark= to run a sleep
of the appropriate duration in parallel with your benchmark:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-user-benchmark --config="specjbb2005-4-JVMs" -- sleep 10
#+END_EXAMPLE
will start data collection, sleep for 10 seconds, then stop data collection
and gather up the results. The config argument is a tag to distinguish this data
collection from any other: you will probably want to make sure it's unique.

This works well for one-off scenarios, but for repeated usage on well defined phase
changes you might want to investigate [[*Triggers][Triggers]].

* Remote hosts

** Multihost benchmarks

Usually, a multihost benchmark is run using a host that acts as the "controller"
of the run. There is a set of hosts on which data collection is to be performed while
the benchmark is running. The controller may or may not be itself part of that set.
In what follows, we assume that the controller has password-less ssh access to the
relevant hosts.

The recommended way to run your workload is to use the generic =pbench-user-benchmark= script.
The workflow in that case is:

- Register the collection tools on *each* host in the set:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for host in $hosts ;do
    pbench-register-tool-set --remote=$host
done
#+END_EXAMPLE
- Invoke =pbench-user-benchmark= with your workload generator as argument: that will start the
  collection tools on all the hosts and then run your workload generator; when that
  finished, it will stop the collection tools on all the hosts and then run the postprocessing
  phase which will gather the data from all the remote hosts and run the postprocessing tools
  on everything.
- Run =pbench-copy-results= or =pbench-move-results= to upload the data to the results server.

If you cannot use the =pbench-user-benchmark= script, then the process becomes more manual.
The workflow is:

- Register the collection tools on *each* host as above.
- Invoke =pbench-start-tools= on the controller: that will start data collection on
  all of the remote hosts.
- Run the workload generator.
- Invoke =pbench-stop-tools= on the controller: that will stop data collection on
  all of the remote hosts.
- Invoke =pbench-postprocess-tools= on the controller: that will gather all the data
  from the remotes and run the postprocessing tools on all the data.
- Run =pbench-copy-results= or =pbench-move-results= to upload the data to the results server.


* Customizing

Some characteristics[fn:3] of pbench are specified in config files and can be customized
by adding your own config file to override the default settings.

TBD

[fn:3] Only a few such characteristics exist today, but the plan is to move
more hardwired things into the config files from the scripts. If you need to
override some setting and have to modify scripts in order to do so, let us
know: that's a good candidate for the config file.


* Best practices

** Clear results
The =pbench-move-results= script removes the results directory (assumed to be
within the =/var/lib/pbench-agent= hierarchy) after copying it the results
repo. But if there are previous results present (perhaps because
=pbench-move-results= was never invoked, or perhaps because =pbench-copy-results=
was invoked instead), =pbench-move-results= will copy *all* of them: you
probably do not want that.

It's a good idea in general to invoke =pbench-clear-results=, which cleans
=/var/lib/pbench-agent=, *before* running your benchmark.

** Kill tools
If you interrupt a built-in benchmark script (or your own script perhaps),
the collection tools are *not* going to be stopped. If you don't stop them
explicitly, they can severely affect subsequent runs that you make. So it
is strongly recommended that you invoke =pbench-kill-tools= before you start your
run:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-kill-tools --group=$group
#+END_EXAMPLE
If you run pbench from your own script, you should add a signal handler to
do this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
trap "pbench-kill-tools --group=$group" EXIT INT QUIT
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Clear tools
This tool will delete the tools.$group file on the local host as well
as on all the remote hosts specified therein.  After doing that, you
will need to re-register all the tools that you want to use. In
combination with =pbench-clear-results=, this tool creates a blank slate
where you can start from scratch. You probably don't want to call
this much, but it may be useful in certain cases (e.g. when the
remotes are created for the test and then disappear at the end - it's
a good idea to call =pbench-clear-tools= from a trap in that case).

** Register tools
Some tools have *required* options[fn:9] and you *have* to specify
them when you register the tool. One example is the =blktrace= tool
which requires a =--devices=/dev/sda,dev/sdb== argument. =pbench-register-tool-set=
knows about such options for the default set of tools, but with other
tools, you are on your own.

The trouble is that registration does not invoke the tool and does not
know what options are required. So the best thing to do is invoke the
tool with =--help=: the =--help= option may or may not be recognized
by any particular tool, but either way you should get a usage message
that labels required options. You can then register the tool by using
an invocation similar to:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-register-tool --name=blktrace -- --devices=/dev/sda,/dev/sdb
#+END_EXAMPLE

[fn:9] Yes, I know: it's an oxymoron.

** Using =--dir=
If you use the tool scripts explicitly, specify =--dir=/var/lib/pbench-agent/<run-id>=
so that all the data are collected in the specified directory. Also, save any data
that your benchmark produces inside that directory: that way, =pbench-move-results=
can move everything to the results warehouse.

Make the =<run-id>= as detailed as possible to disambiguate results. The built-in
benchmark scripts use the following form: =<benchmark>_<config>-<ts>=, e.g
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
fio_bagl-16-4-ceph_2014-12-15_15:58:51
#+END_EXAMPLE
where the =<config>= part (=bagl-16-4-ceph=) comes from the =--config= option and
can be as detailed as you want to make it.

** Using =--remote=
If you are running multihost benchmarks, we strongly encourage you to set up the
tool collections using =--remote=. Choose a driver host (which might or might not
participate in the tool data collection: in the first case, you register tools locally
as well as remotely; in the second, you just register them remotely) and run everything
from it. During the data collection phase, everything will be pulled off the remotes and
copied to the driver host, so it can be moved to the results repo as a single unit.
Consider also using =--label= to label sets of hosts - see [[*Using =--label=][Using =--label=]] for more information.

** Using =--label=
When you register remotes, =--label= can be used to give a meaningful
label to the results subdirectories that come from remote hosts. For
example, use =--label=server" (or client, or vm, or capsule or
whatever else is appropriate for your use case).

* Results handling

** Accessing results on the web

This section describes how to get to your results using a web browser. It describes
how =pbench-move-results= moves the results from your local controller to a centralized
location and what happens there. It also describes the =--prefix= option to =pbench-move-results=
(and =pbench-copy-results=) and a utility script, =pbench-edit-prefix=, that allows you to change how
the results are viewed.

*N.B.* This section applies to the pbench RPM version 0.31-108gf016ed6 and later. If you are
using an earlier version, please upgrade at your earliest convenience.

*** Where to go to see results                                     :external:

Where =pbench-move/copy-results= copies the results is site-dependent. Check with
the admin who set up the pbench server and provided you with the configuration file
for the =pbench-agent= installation.

* Advanced topics

** Triggers
Triggers are groups of tools that are started and stopped on specific events.
They are registered with =pbench-register-tool-trigger= using the =--start-trigger=
and =--stop-trigger= options. The output of the benchmark is piped into the
=pbench-tool-trigger= tool which detects the conditions for starting and stopping
the specified group of tools.

There are some commands specifically for triggers:

- =pbench-register-tool-trigger= :: register start and stop triggers for a tool group.
- =pbench-list-triggers= :: list triggers and their start/stop criteria.
- =pbench-tool-trigger= :: this is a Perl script that looks for the
  start-trigger and end-trigger markers in the benchmark's output,
  starting and stopping the appropriate group of tools when it
  finds the corresponding marker.

As an example, =pbench-dbench= uses three groups of tools: warmup, measurement
and cleanup. It registers these groups as triggers using

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-register-tool-trigger --group=warmup --start-trigger="warmup" --stop-trigger="execute"
pbench-register-tool-trigger --group=measurement --start-trigger="execute" --stop-trigger="cleanup"
pbench-register-tool-trigger --group=cleanup --start-trigger="cleanup" --stop-trigger="Operation"
#+END_EXAMPLE

It then pipes the output of the benchmark into =pbench-tool-trigger=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$benchmark_bin --machine-readable --directory=$dir --timelimit=$runtime
               --warmup=$warmup --loadfile $loadfile $client |
	           tee $benchmark_results_dir/result.txt |
               pbench-tool-trigger "$iteration" "$benchmark_results_dir" no
#+END_EXAMPLE

=pbench-tool-trigger= will then start the warmup group when it encounters the
string "warmup" in the benchmark's output and stop it when it
encounters "execute". It will also start the measurement group when it
encounters "execute" and stop it when it encounters "cleanup" - and so
on.

Obviously, the start/stop conditions will have to be chosen with some
care to ensure correct actions.

* FAQ

** What does =--name= do?
This option is recognized by =pbench-register-tool= and =pbench-unregister-tool=: it
specifies the name of the tool that is to be (un)registered. =pbench-list-tools=
with the =--name= option list all the groups that contain the named tool[fn:7].

[fn:7] A list of available tools in a specific group can be obtained with the
=--group= option of =pbench-list-tools=; unfortunately, there is no option to list
all available tools - the current workaround is to check the contents of
=/opt/pbench-agent/tool-scripts=.

** What does =--config= do?

This option is recognized by the benchmark scripts (see [[*Available benchmark scripts][Available benchmark
scripts]] above) which use it as a tag for the directory where the benchmark is
going to run. The default value is empty.  The run directory for the benchmark
is constructed this way:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$pbench_run/${benchmark}_${config}_$date
#+END_EXAMPLE

where =$pbench_run= and =$date= are set by the =/opt/pbench-agent/base= script
and =$benchmark= is set to the obvious value by the benchmark script; e.g. a
fio run with config=foo would run in the directory
=/var/lib/pbench-agent/fio_foo_2014-11-10_15:47:04=.

** What does =--dir= do?

This option is recognized by =pbench-start-tools=, =pbench-stop-tools=,
=pbench-tool-trigger= and =pbench-postprocess-tools=.  It specifies the directory
where the tools are going to stash their data. The default value is =/tmp=.
Each group then uses it as a prefix for its own stash, which has the form
=$dir/tools-$group=. Part of the stash is the set of cmds to start and stop
the tools - they are stored in =$dir/tools-$group/cmds=. The output of the
tool is in =$dir/tools-$group/$tool.txt=.

This option *has* to be specified identically for each command when
invoking these commands (actually, each of the commands should be invoked
with the identical set of *all* options, not just =--dir=.)

If you use these tools explicitly (i.e. you don't use one of the
benchmark scripts), it is *highly* recommended that you specify this
option explicitly and not rely on the =/tmp= default. For one, you
should make sure that different iterations of your benchmark use a
*different* value for this option, otherwise later results will
overwrite earlier ones.

*N.B.* If you want to run =pbench-move-results= or =pbench-copy-results= after the
end of the run, your results should be under =/var/lib/pbench-agent=:
=pbench-move/copy-results= does not know anything about your choice for this
option; it only looks in =/var/lib/pbench-agent= for results to upload. So
if you are planning to use =pbench-move/copy-results=, make sure that the
specified directory is a subdirectory of =/var/lib/pbench-agent=.

** What does =--remote= do?
pbench can register tools on remote hosts, start them and stop them remotely and gather up
the results from the remote hosts for post-processing. The model is that one has a controller
or orchestrator and a bunch of remote hosts that participate in the benchmark run.

The pbench setup is as follows: =pbench-register-tool-set= or =pbench-register-tool=
is called on the controller with the =--remote= option, once for each
remote host:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
for remote in $remotes ;do
    pbench-register-tool-set --remote=$remote --label=foo --group=$group
done
#+END_EXAMPLE
That has two effects: it adds a stanza for the tool to
the appropriate =tools-$group= directory on the remote host and it also adds
a stanza like this to the controller =tools-$group= directory's file for the
remote host:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
remote@<host>:<label>
#+END_EXAMPLE
The label is optionally specified with =--label= and is empty by default.

When =pbench-start-tools= is called on the controller, it starts the local
collection (if any), but it also interprets the above stanzas and
starts the appropriate tools on the remote hosts. Similarly for
=pbench-stop-tools= and =pbench-postprocess-tools=.

** What does =--label= do?
TBD
** How to add a collection tool
Tool scripts are mostly boilerplate: they need to take a standard set
of commands (--install, --start, --stop, --postprocess) and a standard
set of options (--iteration, --group, --dir, --interval,
--options). Consequently, the easiest thing to do is to take an
existing script and modify it slightly to call the tool of your
choice. I describe here the case of turbostat.

There are some tools that timestamp each output stanza; there are others
that do not. In the former case, make sure to use whatever option the tool
requires to include such timestamps (e.g. vmstat -t on RHEL6 or RHEL7 - but
strangely *not* on Fedora 20 - will produce such timestamps).

There are some tools that are included in the default installation -
others need to be installed separately. Turbostat is not always
installed by default, so the tool script installs the
package (which is named differently on RHEL6 and RHEL7) if necessary.
In some cases (e.g. the sysstat tools), we provide an RPM in the pbench
repo and the tool script makes sure to install that if necessary.

The only other knowledge required is where the tool executable resides
(usually /usr/bin/<tool> or /usr/local/bin/<tool> - /usr/bin/turbostat
in this case) and the default options to pass to the tool (which can
be modified by passing --options to the tool script).

So here are the non-boilerplate portions of the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/tool-scripts/kvm-spinlock][turbostat]] tool
script. The first interesting part is to set =tool_bin= to point to
the binary:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Defaults
tool=$script_name
tool_bin=/usr/bin/$tool
#+END_EXAMPLE
This only works if the script is named the same as the tool, which
is encouraged. If the installed location of your tool is not =/usr/bin=,
then adjust accordingly.

Since turbostat does not provide a timestamp option, we define a
datalog script to add timestamps (no need for that for vmstat e.g.)
and use that as the tool command:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
case "$script_name" in
    turbostat)
	tool_cmd="$script_path/datalog/$tool-datalog $interval $tool_output_file"
	;;
esac
#+END_EXAMPLE
The [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/tool-scripts/datalog/turbostat-datalog][datalog script]] uses the =pbench-log-timestamp= pbench utility to timestamp the
output. It will then be up to the postprocessing script to tease out the data
appropriately.

The last interesting part dispatches on the command - the install is turbostat-specific,
but the rest is boilerplate: =--start= just executes the =tool_cmd= as defined above
and stashes away the pid, so that =--stop= can kill the command later; =--postprocess=
calls the separate post-processing script (see below):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
release=$(awk '{x=$7; split(x, a, "."); print a[1];}' /etc/redhat-release)
case $release in
    6)
        pkg=cpupowerutils
        ;;
    7)
        pkg=kernel-tools
        ;;
    ,*)
        # better be installed already
        ;;
esac

case "$mode" in
    install)
	if [ ! -e $tool_bin ]; then
            yum install $pkg
	        echo $script_name is installed
	else
	        echo $script_name is installed
	fi
    start)
	mkdir -p $tool_output_dir
	echo "$tool_cmd" >$tool_cmd_file
	debug_log "$script_name: running $tool_cmd"
	$tool_cmd >>"$tool_output_file" & echo $! >$tool_pid_file
	wait
	;;
    stop)
	pid=`cat "$tool_pid_file"`
	debug_log "stopping $script_name"
	kill $pid && /bin/rm "$tool_pid_file"
	;;
    postprocess)
	debug_log "postprocessing $script_name"
	$script_path/postprocess/$script_name-postprocess $tool_output_dir
	;;
esac
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally, there is the post-processing tool: the simplest thing to do
is nothing.  That's currently the case for the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/tool-scripts/postprocess/turbostat-postprocess][turbostat]]
post-processing tool, but ideally it should produce a JSON file with
the data points and an HTML file that uses the nv3 library to plot
the data graphically in a browser. See the [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/tool-scripts/postprocess][postprocess]] directory for
examples, e.g. [[https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/tool-scripts/postprocess/iostat-postprocess][the iostat postprocessing tool]].

** How to add a benchmark
TBD
** How do I collect data for a short time while my benchmark is running?

Running
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-user-benchmark -- sleep 60
#+END_EXAMPLE
will start whatever data collections are specified in the default tool
group, then sleep for 60 seconds. At the end of that period, it will
stop the running collections tools and postprocess the collected data.
Running =pbench-move-results= afterwards will move the results to the results
server as usual.

** I have a script to run my benchmark - how do I use it with pbench?
pbench is a set of building blocks, so it allows you to use it in many different
ways, but it also makes certain assumptions which if not satisfied, lead to problems.

Let's assume that you want to run a number of =iozone= experiments, each with different
parameters. Your script probably contains a loop, running one experiment each time around.
If you can change your script so that it executes *one* experiment specified by an argument,
then  the best way is to use the =pbench-user-benchmark= script:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-register-tool-set
for exp in experiment1 experiment2 experiment3 ;do
    pbench-user-benchmark --config $exp -- my-script.sh $exp
done
pbench-move-results
#+END_EXAMPLE
The results are going to end up in directories named =/var/lib/pbench-agent/pbench-user-benchmark_$exp_$ts=
for each experiment (unfortunately, the timestamp will be recalculated at the beginning of
each =pbench-user-benchmark= invocation), before being uploaded to the results server.

Alternatively, you can modify your script so that each experiment is wrapped with start/stop/postprocess-tools
and then call =pbench-move-results= at the end:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pbench-register-tool-set
dir=/var/lib/pbench-agent
tool_group=default
typeset -i iter=1
for exp in experiment1 experiment2 experiment3 ;do
    pbench-start-tools --group=$tool_group --dir=$dir --iteration=$iter
    <run the experiment>
    pbench-stop-tools --group=$tool_group --dir=$dir --iteration=$iter
    pbench-postprocess-tools --group=$tool_group --dir=$dir --iteration=$iter
    iter=$iter+1
done
pbench-move-results
#+END_EXAMPLE
*N.B.* You need to invoke the =pbench-{start,stop,postprocess}-tools= scripts
with the *same* arguments.
