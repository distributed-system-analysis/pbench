# Run commands within a container image.
#
# Several customizing inputs can be given via environment variables:
#
# EXTRA_PODMAN_SWITCHES [-it]
# IMAGE_REPO [quay.io/pbench]
# IMAGE_NAME [pbench-ci-fedora]
# IMAGE      [${IMAGE_REPO}/${IMAGE_NAME}:<branch_name>]
#            Container image to run. If defined, will override the $IMAGE_*
#            values above.
# CONTAINER_HOST [] (see podman-remote man page)
#            May be defined to control remote container execution; will already
#            be defined, if running inside a container invoked by this script,
#            to point to the current host.
# WORKSPACE: [$(pwd)]
#            The directory containing the Git checkout -- in the Jenkins
#            environment this is set and setup for us; otherwise, it defaults to
#            the current working directory, which is required by this script to
#            be a Git checkout.
#            NOTE:  if we're already running inside a container this is the path
#            to the checkout on the HOST file system; inside the container, it
#            will be mapped to /home/${USER}/pbench.
# WORKSPACE_TMP: []
#            If defined, used as the mapping for /home/${USER} in the container
#            (inside the container, the Git checkout will be mounted over the
#            pbench subdirectory).  In the Jenkins environment, this points to a
#            place where we can create a temporary directory tree. In a local
#            environment, defining this value (e.g., to /home/${USER} _outside_
#            the container) will allow the user to receive files created inside
#            the container.
#            NOTE:  if we're already running inside a container this is either
#            the path to the directory on the HOST file system or a Podman volume.
#
# For example, run an interactive bash shell:
#
#     EXTRA_PODMAN_SWITCHES=-it jenkins/run bash
#
# Or ensure the latest image is used:
#
#     EXTRA_PODMAN_SWITCHES=--pull=always jenkins/run tox
#
# Or perhaps to check out a locally built CI container image:
#
#     EXTRA_PODMAN_SWITCHES=-it IMAGE_REPO=localhost jenkins/run bash

# this is a temporary but named volume which will be deleted by this script
# after the container exits (if it is not in use by another container), and
# $WORKSPACE_TMP inside the container is set to it so that any containers
# created inside this container will use the same volume for their $HOME_DIR.
