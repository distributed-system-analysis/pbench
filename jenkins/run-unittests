# For the CI jobs, we run unit tests expecting most of the environment to be
# provided by the container image, and only a few modules not installable via
# RPM need to be added (see jenkins/python-setup.sh).  We then instruct tox to
# use the current environment (not setting up a virtualenv), and to run the
# tests using whatever version of the python interpreter the install provides
# (the `py` directs Tox to use whatever it finds).
