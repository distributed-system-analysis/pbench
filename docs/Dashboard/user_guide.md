# Pbench Dashboard 

Pbench Dashboard is the web-based platform for consuming indexed performance benchmark data. It provides data curation capabilities for the performance datasets.

The landing page is the browsing page where the user can view the list of public datasets. Those datasets can be filtered based on name and/or uploaded time.

It has three components.
