This release is a point release for v0.72.0. It fixes one problem that was found just as we were releasing v0.72.0. The problem was that `pbench-postprocess-tools` was not handling labeled hosts correctly (labels may be attached to hosts during tool registration). See issue #3454 and PR #3456 for a fuller description.

Installation is as described in the [v0.72.0 release notes](https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/releases/tag/v0.72.0). The version of the pbench-agent RPM for this release  is 0.72.1-1g7d727fec5.
