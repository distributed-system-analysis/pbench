# pbench
A benchmarking and performance analysis framework

The code base includes three sub-systems. The first being the collection
`agent`, or harness, responsible for providing commands for running benchmarks
across one or more systems, while properly collecting the configuration of
those systems, their logs, and specified telemetry from various tools (`sar`,
`vmstat`, `perf`, etc.).

The second sub-system including here is `bgtasks`, or back-ground tasks, which
are responsible for archiving result tar balls, indexing them, and unpacking
them for display.

The third sub-system is the web server pieces using to enable the display of
the graphs and any content generated by the background tasks.
