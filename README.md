# Pbench
A Benchmarking and Performance Analysis Framework

The code base includes three sub-systems. The first is the collection agent
or harness, `pbench-agent`, responsible for providing commands for running
benchmarks across one or more systems, while properly collecting the
configuration of those systems, their logs, and specified telemetry from
various tools (`sar`, `vmstat`, `perf`, etc.).

The second sub-system included here is `pbench-server`,
which is responsible for archiving result tar balls, indexing them, and
unpacking them for display.

The third sub-system is the web server JS and CSS files used to display various
graphs and results, and any other content generated by the background tasks,
or by the `pbench-agent` during benchmark and tool post-processing steps.

## How is it installed?
Instructions on installing `pbench-agent`, can be found
in the [PBench agent installation](http://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/doc/agent/installation.html) guide.

For Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL users, we have made available [COPR
builds](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/ndokos/pbench/) for the
`pbench-agent`, `configtools`, `pbench-server`, `pbench-web-server`
and some benchmark and tool packages.

This assumes that somebody has already installed the server bits. The
procedure to do that is described in the [PBench Server
Installation](http://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/doc/server/installation.html)
guide.

You can install the `web-server` subsystem
on the machine where you run `pbench` from. That allows you to view the graphs before sending
the results to the server, or even if there is no server to send the results to. See
the [PBench web server installation](http://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/doc/server/pbench-web-server.html)
guide.

## How do I use pbench?
Refer to the [PBench User Guide](http://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/doc/agent/user-guide.html).

super quick set of introductory steps.
