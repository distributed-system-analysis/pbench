# Pbench
A Benchmarking and Performance Analysis Framework

The code base includes three sub-systems. The first is the collection agent,
`pbench-agent`, responsible for providing commands for running benchmarks
across one or more systems, while properly collecting the configuration data
for those systems, and specified telemetry or data from various tools (`sar`,
`vmstat`, `perf`, etc.).

The second sub-system is the `pbench-server`, which is responsible for
archiving result tar balls, indexing them, and unpacking them for display.

The third sub-system is the `web-server` JS and CSS files, used to display
various graphs and results, and any other content generated by the
`pbench-agent` during benchmark and tool post-processing steps.

The pbench Dashboard code lives in its own [repository](
https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench-dashboard).

## How is it installed?
Instructions on installing `pbench-agent`, can be found
in the Pbench Agent [Getting Started Guide](
https://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/start.html).

For Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL users, we have made available [COPR
builds](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/ndokos/pbench/) for the
`pbench-agent`, `pbench-server`, `pbench-web-server`, and some benchmark and
tool packages.

Install the `pbench-web-server` package on the machine from where you want to
run the `pbench-agent` workloads, allowing you to view the graphs before
sending the results to a server, or even if there is no server configured to
send results.

You might want to consider browsing through the [rest of the documentation](

## How do I use pbench?
Refer to the [Pbench Agent Getting Started Guide](
https://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/start.html).

TL;DR? See [TL;DR - How to set up the `pbench-agent` and run a benchmark
](https://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/doc.html#how) of the
[Pbench Agent Getting Started Guide](

super quick set of introductory steps.

## Where is the source kept?
The latest source code is at
https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench.

The pbench dashboard code is maintained separately at
https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench-dashboard.

## Is there a mailing list for discussions?

Yes, we use [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pbench)

## Is there a place to track current and future work items?
Yes, we are using GitHub [Projects](
https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/projects).
Please find projects covering the [Agent](
https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/projects/2),
[Server](https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/projects/3),
and a project that is named the same as the current [milestone](
https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/milestones).

## Pbench Release Tag Scheme (GitHub)
We employ a simple major, minor, release, build (optional) scheme for tagging
starting with the `v0.70.0` release (`v<Major>.<Minor>.<Release>[-<Build>]`).
Prior to the v0.70.0 release, the scheme used was mostly `v<Major>.<Minor>`,
where we only had minor releases (`Major = 0`).

The practice of using `-agent` or `-server` is also ending with the `v0.70.0`
release.

### Container Image Tags
This same GitHub "tag" scheme is used with tags applied to container images
we build, with the following exceptions for tag names:

  * `latest` - always points to the "latest" container image pushed to a
    repository

  * `v<Major>-latest` - always points to the "latest" `Major` released
    image

  * `v<Major>.<Minor>-latest` - always points to the "latest" release
    for `Major`.`Minor` released images

  * `<SHA1 git hash>` (9 characters) - commit hash of the checked out code
