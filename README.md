# Pbench [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/distributed-system-analysis/pbench.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/distributed-system-analysis/pbench)
A Benchmarking and Performance Analysis Framework

The code base includes three sub-systems. The first being the collection agent
or harness, `pbench-agent`, responsible for providing commands for running
benchmarks across one or more systems, while properly collecting the
configuration of those systems, their logs, and specified telemetry from
various tools (`sar`, `vmstat`, `perf`, etc.).

The second sub-system included here is `bgtasks`, or "back-ground tasks",
which is responsible for archiving result tar balls, indexing them, and
unpacking them for display.

The third sub-system included here is the web server used to display various
graphs and results, and any other content generated by the background tasks,
or by the `pbench-agent` during benchmark and tool post-processing steps.

## How is it installed?
Instructions on installing `pbench-agent`, and other components, can be found
in the "[How to
Install](http://distributed-system-analysis.github.io/pbench/pbench-agent.html#sec-5)"
