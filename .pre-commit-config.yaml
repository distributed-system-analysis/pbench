# `black` complains loudly that fio-histo-log-pctile.py is not a python file,
# which it isn't, and also complains about the long forgotten demo.py file, so
# we ignore them both.
#
# We must duplicate these excludes also listed in pyproject.toml because the
# commands below are explicitly invoked on the files added or changed.  This
# exclude prevents those checks being run.
