# Example Apache configuration file
#
# To run with local Apache reverse proxy and Dashboard mapping, customize this
# file as necessary and copy to /etc/https/conf.d/pbench.conf then restart the
# httpd service.
#
# NOTE: while this file should work as-is, using the routable hostname
# or IP is highly recommended. The pbench-in-a-can container deployment will
# filter this file, replacing the local host placeholder with the full IP:
# pay attention to server/pbenchinacan/container-build.sh when editing this!
