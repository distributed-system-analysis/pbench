# Usage: pbench-verify-backup-tarballs <primary> <backup> <pbench> [ <pbench-local> ]

# Method: in each directory, concatenate all the .md5 files and
# pass them to md5sum for verification (eliminate DUPLICATEs for now: they
# are handled incorrectly by pbench-{move,copy}-results and that needs to
# be fixed).

# For each directory, select all the files that don't pass the md5 check
# and report them. TBD: Report also whether the two sets match between directories
# (IOW, if they were corrupted to begin with).

# Then compare the rest: there might be a few more files in the primary dir
# than in the backup dir, if any additional tarballs have been sent and the
# backup has not dealt with them yet. That is reported but it's only temporary
# so it's OK.

# Any other discrepancy is flagged and reported.

# The second argument is specific to this script: it's the backup
# directory.  The first and the (optional) third arg are consumed by
# pbench-base.sh.  This is the same convention that is used by
# pbench-backup-tarballs.
