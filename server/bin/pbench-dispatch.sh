# This script is the first part of the pipeline that processes pbench
# results tarballs.

# First stage:  pbench-dispatch looks in all the TODO directories,
#               checks MD5 sums and creates symlinks in all the state
#               directories for the particular environment where this
#               server runs (e.g. for the production environment, links
#               are created in the TO-UNPACK, TO-INDEX, TO-COPY-SOS and
#               TO-BACKUP directories; for a satellite, it will only
#               create links in the TO-UNPACK and TO-SYNC directories).
#               Then the symlink in TODO is deleted: we don't want to
#               deal with this tarball again; but if there are recover-
#               able errors, we may keep it in TODO and try again later.
#               Any errors are reported for possible action by an admin.
#

# assumptions:
# - this script runs as a cron job
# - tarballs and md5 sums are uploaded by pbench-move/copy-results to
#   $ARCHIVE/$(hostname -s) area.
# FIXME: the above should be to the reception area ...
# - pbench-move/copy-results also makes a symlink to each tarball it
#   uploads in $ARCHIVE/TODO, thereby telling this script to process
#   the tarball.
# FIXME: the pbench shims do that now ...
