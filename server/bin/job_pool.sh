# Job pooling for bash shell scripts
# This script provides a job pooling functionality where you can keep up to n
# processes/functions running in parallel so that you don't saturate a system
# with concurrent processes.
#
# Got inspiration from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441509/how-to-write-a-process-pool-bash-shell
