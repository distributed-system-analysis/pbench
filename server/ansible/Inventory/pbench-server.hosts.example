# Change the [servers] section to the set of hosts where you want to
# install pbench-server. The various hosts can be running any
# combinations of RHEL7, RHEL8, or (supported) Fedora versions
# (currently 28, 29 and 30). Installing on more than one server (e.g.
# on a master as well as a satellite server) will require more
# setup and is described in the server/ansible/README.org file.

[servers]
<pbench-server-host>

# Variables for this group are defined in ./group_vars/servers
