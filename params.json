The first being the collection\r\n`agent`, or harness, responsible for providing commands for running benchmarks\r\nacross one or more systems, while properly collecting the configuration of\r\nthose systems, their logs, and specified telemetry from various tools (`sar`,\r\n`vmstat`, `perf`, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe second sub-system including here is `bgtasks`, or back-ground tasks, which\r\nare responsible for archiving result tar balls, indexing them, and unpacking\r\nthem for display.\r\n\r\nThe third sub-system is the web server pieces using to enable the display of\r\nthe graphs and any content generated by the background tasks.\r\n\r\n## How is it installed?\r\nPlease read ./doc/INSTALL\r\n\r\n## How do I use pbench?\r\nPlease read ./doc/GETTING_STARTED\r\n\r\n## Where is the source kept?\r\nThe latest source code is here:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench\r\n\r\n## Is there a mailing list for discussions?\r\nYes, we use Google Groups:\r\n\r\n    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pbench\r\n\r\n## Is there a place to track current and future work?\r\nYes, we are using Waffle.io for that:\r\n\r\n    https://waffle.io/distributed-system-analysis/pbench\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
